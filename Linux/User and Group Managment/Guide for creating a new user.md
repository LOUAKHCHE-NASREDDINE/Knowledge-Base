### Step 1: Create the New User

1. **Basic User Creation:**
   - To create a new user with a home directory and bash as the default shell, use the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <username>
     ```
   - Breakdown of options:
     - `-m`: Creates the user's home directory at `/home/<username>`.
     - `-s /bin/bash`: Sets bash as the default shell for the user.

2. **Creating a User with a Specific Group:**
   - By default, `useradd` creates a group with the same name as the username. If you want the user to belong to a different group, use the `-g` option:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g <groupname> <username>
     ```

3. **Creating a User with a Custom Home Directory:**
   - If you need to set a different home directory, use the `-d` option:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -d /custom/path/<username> -s /bin/bash <username>
     ```

---

### Step 2: Set the User’s Password

- After creating the user, you need to set a password for them:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd <username>
  ```
- The system will prompt you to enter and confirm the new password.

### Step 3: Verify the User’s Settings

1. **Check User’s Entry in `/etc/passwd`:**
   - Verify that the user’s shell and home directory are correctly set by checking the `/etc/passwd` file:
     ```bash
     getent passwd <username>
     ```
   - The output should show something like:
     ```bash
     username:x:1001:1001::/home/username:/bin/bash
     ```

2. **Check the Group:**
   - Ensure the user is assigned to the correct group:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```
   - This will list all groups that the user belongs to.


---

### Step 4: Additional Configuration (Optional)

1. **Adding the User to Additional Groups:**
   - If you want the user to be part of multiple groups, you can add them using:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
   - The `-aG` option appends the user to the specified groups.

2. **Setting Up User Directories and Permissions:**
   - You might want to set specific permissions for the user’s home directory or create additional directories:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /home/<username>/projects
     sudo chown <username>:<groupname> /home/<username>/projects
     sudo chmod 755 /home/<username>/projects
     ```

3. **Configuring User’s Shell Environment:**
   - To customize the user’s shell environment (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`), you can copy default configurations or set up custom ones:
     ```bash
     sudo cp /etc/skel/.bashrc /home/<username>/
     sudo chown <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.bashrc
     ```


---

### Step 5: Test the User Account

- **Switch to the New User:**
   - To test the user account, switch to the new user:
     ```bash
     su - <username>
     ```
   - This will log you in as the new user, using their environment settings.

- **Check the Default Shell:**
   - Ensure that the bash shell is active:
     ```bash
     echo $SHELL
     ```
   - It should return `/bin/bash`.


---

### Final Notes

- **User Deletion:**
   - If you ever need to delete the user, along with their home directory, use:
     ```bash
     sudo userdel -r <username>
     ```
   - The `-r` option ensures that the user’s home directory is also removed.
