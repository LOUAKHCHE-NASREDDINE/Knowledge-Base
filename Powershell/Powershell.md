# PowerShell Basics

1. **Listing Files and Folders**: To get a list of all files and folders in the current directory, you can use:

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem
   ```

2. **Creating a New Folder**: To create a new folder named "TestFolder" in the current directory:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -Path . -Name "TestFolder" -ItemType "directory"
   ```

3. **Finding All Files with a Specific Extension**: To find all `.txt` files in the current directory:

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Filter *.txt
   ```

4. **Reading a Text File**: To display the content of a text file named "example.txt":

   ```powershell
   Get-Content example.txt
   ```

5. **Copying Files**: To copy a file named "example.txt" to a folder named "Backup":

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path example.txt -Destination .\Backup\
   ```

6. **Moving Files**: To move a file named "example.txt" to a folder named "Archive":

   ```powershell
   Move-Item -Path example.txt -Destination .\Archive\
   ```

7. **Deleting a File**: To delete a file named "oldfile.txt":

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item oldfile.txt
   ```

8. **Writing to a File**: To add text to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist:

   ```powershell
   Add-Content -Path log.txt -Value "New log entry"
   ```

9. **Getting System Information**: To display basic system information:

   ```powershell
   Get-ComputerInfo
   ```

10. **Searching for a Specific Process**: To find a process with the name "notepad":

    ```powershell
    Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "notepad" }
    ```

PowerShell cmdlets with some shell examples and explanations:

1. **Get-TimeZone**: This command retrieves information about the system's current time zone.

   ```powershell
   Get-TimeZone
   ```

   Output: Displays details of the current time zone.

2. **Get-Command**: Used to list all available cmdlets, functions, workflows, etc., in the PowerShell environment.

   ```powershell
   Get-Command *
   ```

   Output: Lists all commands available in your PowerShell session.

   To find commands related to processes:

   ```powershell
   Get-Command *process*
   ```

   Output: Shows commands that include the word "process".

   For commands related to files:

   ```powershell
   Get-Command *file*
   ```

   Output: Lists commands containing the word "file".

3. **Get-Help**: Provides help information for PowerShell commands.

   For Windows users to get help about `Stop-Process`:

   ```powershell
   Get-Help Stop-Process
   ```

   For Linux/macOS or to get online help:

   ```powershell
   Get-Help Stop-Process -Online
   ```

   To see examples:

   ```powershell
   Get-Help Stop-Process -Examples
   ```

   Output: Displays examples of how to use `Stop-Process`.

4. **Get-Member**: Shows the properties and methods of objects.

   For date object:

   ```powershell
   Get-Date | Get-Member
   ```

   For a random number object:

   ```powershell
   Get-Random | Get-Member
   ```

   Output: Lists properties and methods of the respective objects.

5. **Format-List**: Displays all available properties of an object in a list.

   ```powershell
   Get-Date | Format-List
   ```

   Output: Shows all properties of the `DateTime` object.

6. **Find-Module**: Searches for modules in the online PowerShell gallery.

   ```powershell
   Find-Module -Tag Telegram
   ```

   Output: Lists modules tagged with "Telegram".

These examples illustrate the basics of using each cmdlet. You can experiment with different parameters and inputs to see various outputs and get a better understanding of how each cmdlet works.

# the pipeline operator

You're exploring some very practical and powerful aspects of PowerShell, especially the use of the pipeline operator (`|`). Let's break down these examples:

1. **Sorting Processes by ID**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Sort-Object Id
   ```
   This command gets all running processes and sorts them by their ID.

2. **Piping Every Command to Get-Help**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Command | Get-Help
   ```
   Here, every command available is passed to `Get-Help`, which might not be practical due to the sheer number of commands.

3. **Restarting a Service (BITS)**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Service -Name BITS | Restart-Service
   ```
   This fetches the BITS service and restarts it. It's a direct and efficient way to manage services.

4. **Simulating Process Termination**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Stop-Process -WhatIf
   ```
   Using `-WhatIf` shows what would happen if the command were run, without actually performing the action.

5. **ForEach-Object and $PSItem**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | ForEach-Object {$PSItem}
   ```
   This passes each process object to `ForEach-Object`, where `$PSItem` (or `$_` as a shorthand) represents the current object in the pipeline.

6. **Format-List & Format-Table**:
   - Comparing the outputs of `Format-Table` and `Format-List` for processes:
     ```powershell
     Get-Process | Format-Table
     Get-Process | Format-List
     ```
   - Similarly for `Get-Date`:
     ```powershell
     Get-Date
     Get-Date | Format-List
     ```

7. **Select-Object**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Select-Object Name,Id,CPU,Responding
   ```
   This selects specific properties of process objects, making the output more focused.

8. **Sorting by CPU Usage**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU
   ```
   Sorts processes based on their CPU usage. Combining `Select-Object` and `Sort-Object` can be very efficient for targeted information.

9. **Where-Object Filtering**:
   - Filtering processes by CPU time:
     ```powershell
     Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 15}
     ```
   - Filtering large files in the `$HOME` directory:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem $HOME -Recurse | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 5MB}
     ```
   - Counting large files:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem $HOME -Recurse | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 50MB} | Measure-Object
     ```

These examples demonstrate how to leverage the pipeline for efficient data processing in PowerShell. The pipeline is one of the most powerful features in PowerShell, allowing for concise and readable code.

# State of the Shell

You're delving into useful commands for determining the PowerShell version you're running and exploring the differences in cmdlet counts between PowerShell versions. Let's discuss these:

1. **Determining PowerShell Version**:
   To find out the version of PowerShell you're running, use `$PSVersionTable`:

   ```powershell
   $PSVersionTable
   ```

   This command shows a table of version-related information for your PowerShell environment. To specifically get the PowerShell version, use:

   ```powershell
   $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
   ```

   This command directly outputs the version number.

2. **Counting Cmdlets in Different PowerShell Versions**:
   - In PowerShell 5.1:
     ```powershell
     Get-Command | Measure-Object
     ```
     This will count the number of cmdlets and functions available in PowerShell 5.1.
   - In PowerShell 6+ (which is cross-platform and a separate product from Windows PowerShell 5.1):
     ```powershell
     Get-Command | Measure-Object
     ```
     You might notice a different count due to the architectural changes and cmdlet updates in PowerShell Core 6+.

3. **Installing the WindowsCompatibility Module in PowerShell 6+**:
   In PowerShell 6+, you can install the `WindowsCompatibility` module to access cmdlets from Windows PowerShell that are not available by default in PowerShell Core. Run:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module WindowsCompatibility -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This command installs the `WindowsCompatibility` module for the current user only, and it's particularly useful if you need to use legacy cmdlets that aren't part of the newer PowerShell versions.

Remember, PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 6+ (Core) are different versions. PowerShell Core 6+ was a major update with cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS), but some of the Windows-specific cmdlets were not carried over, hence the need for the `WindowsCompatibility` module in certain scenarios.

# PowerhShell Development

Setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for PowerShell development. Here's a breakdown of what you're doing:

1. **Listing and Installing Extensions in VS Code**:
   - `code --list-extensions`: This command, when run in the terminal, lists all the installed extensions in your VS Code setup.
   - `code --install-extension ms-vscode.PowerShell`: This command installs the PowerShell extension for VS Code, which is essential for PowerShell scripting within the editor.

2. **PowerShell Base VS Code Settings**:
   Your JSON configuration sets up various settings for the PowerShell environment in VS Code. Let's go through the key settings:

   - `"editor.quickSuggestionsDelay": 1`: Sets a delay of 1 millisecond for displaying quick suggestions.
   - `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"`: Enables tab completion in the editor, which can help speed up coding.
   - `"files.defaultLanguage": "powershell"`: Sets PowerShell as the default language for new files.

   - PowerShell Specific Settings:
     - `"powershell.powerShellAdditionalExePaths"`: Specifies custom paths for different versions of PowerShell. Useful if you have multiple versions installed and want to switch between them easily in VS Code.
     - `"powershell.powerShellDefaultVersion": "PS7"`: Sets PowerShell 7 as the default version to use in the integrated console.
     - `"powershell.codeFormatting.preset":"Stroustrup"`: Applies the Stroustrup code formatting style to your PowerShell scripts.
     - `"powershell.startAutomatically": true`: Ensures that the PowerShell extension starts automatically when you open a PowerShell file.
     - `"powershell.scriptAnalysis.enable": true`: Enables script analysis, which can provide code suggestions and best practices.
     - `"powershell.integratedConsole.showOnStartup": false`: Prevents the integrated console from showing up automatically on startup.
     - `"powershell.integratedConsole.focusConsoleOnExecute": true`: Focuses on the console when you execute a script, which is useful for seeing output or entering data.

These settings optimize your VS Code environment for an efficient PowerShell scripting experience, tailored to personal preferences and workflow. It's a good setup for both learning and professional script development.

## Explanation

Your script includes a wide range of PowerShell concepts, from handling variables and data types to using cmdlets for system information and file management. Let's break down these concepts and examine the different parts of your script:

### Basic Cmdlets and Variables
- `Get-Process` retrieves all currently running processes.
- `$processes = Get-Process` stores the output of `Get-Process` in the variable `$processes` for further use, reducing the need to repeatedly call `Get-Process`.

### Using Variables with Cmdlets
- Variables like `$processes` are used with pipeline operations to filter or sort data. For example:
  - `$processes | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 5000 }` finds processes using more than 5000 CPU units.
  - `$processes | Sort-Object WorkingSet64 -Descending` sorts processes by memory usage in descending order.

### Understanding Data Types
- PowerShell is not strongly typed by default, meaning you can assign different types of data to the same variable without explicit declarations.
- **Example with integers**:
  - `$num1 = 2; $num2 = 2; $total = $num1 + $num2` results in `$total` being `4`.
- **Example with strings**:
  - `$num1 = '2'; $num2 = '2'; $total = $num1 + $num2` results in `$total` being `'22'`, illustrating string concatenation instead of arithmetic addition.

### Strong Typing
- You can enforce data types by declaring a type:
  - `[int]$num1 = '2'` ensures `$num1` is treated as an integer.

### Conversions
- Converting data types is straightforward:
  - `$stringReturn = $total.ToString()` converts `$total` to a string.
- The `Get-Member` cmdlet reveals the methods and properties associated with a variable or object.

### String Interpolation and Quotes
- Single quotes (`'`) are used for literals.
- Double quotes (`"`) are used for interpolation (expanding variables and expressions within strings).
- **Example**:
  - `$literal = 'Two plus one equals: $(1 + 2)'` does not expand the expression.
  - `$escaped = "Two plus one equals: $(1 + 2)"` evaluates the expression, displaying "Two plus one equals: 3".

### Environment Variables and Constants
- Environment variables like `$env:COMPUTERNAME` can be accessed directly.
- Constants like `$HOME` should not be reassigned as they are reserved.

### Practical Application Example
- The script prompts for a file path and scans for large files (greater than 100MB), counting them and displaying the count.
  - `Read-Host` captures user input.
  - `Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Recurse` retrieves files and directories.
  - The files are filtered and counted, and the results are displayed using `Write-Host`.

This example demonstrates powerful ways to use PowerShell for automation and system management tasks, highlighting its flexibility and capability in handling various data types and operations seamlessly.

Write-Host "Total Size of files: $($totalSize / 1MB) MB"

#-------------------------------------------------

```
## Explanation

### Conditional Statements (`if`, `elseif`, `else`)
Your script uses basic conditional structures to check if a specific file path exists:

```powershell
$path = 'C:\Test' #windows
$evalPath = Test-Path $path
if ($evalPath -eq $true) {
    Write-Host "$path VERIFIED"
}
elseif ($evalPath -eq $false) {
    Write-Host "$path NOT VERIFIED"
}
```
This effectively checks whether `$path` exists and prints a message accordingly.

### Switch Statement
You've implemented a switch statement that reacts based on the user's input:

```powershell
[int]$aValue = Read-Host 'Enter a number'
switch ($aValue) {
    1 { Write-Host 'You entered the number ONE' }
    2 { Write-Host 'You entered the number TWO' }
    ... and so on ...
    Default { Write-Host "Sorry, I don't know what to do with $aValue" }
}
```
This is a neat way of handling multiple conditional branches, providing a specific output for each recognized input and a default response otherwise.

### Loops
You've demonstrated the use of `for`, `foreach`, and `do-while` loops, showing different applications like printing sequences, reversing strings, calculating total file sizes, and verifying paths:

- **For Loop** (Color output and string reversal):
  ```powershell
  for ($i = 0; $i -le 15; $i++) {
      Write-Host $i -ForegroundColor $i
  }

  $aString = 'Jean-Luc Picard'
  $reverseString = ''
  for ($i = $aString.Length; $i -ge 0; $i--) {
      $reverseString += $aString[$i]
  }
  ```

- **Foreach Loop** (Summing file sizes):
  ```powershell
  $path = 'C:\Test'
  [int]$totalSize = 0
  $fileInfo = Get-ChildItem $path -Recurse
  foreach ($file in $fileInfo) {
      $totalSize += $file.Length
  }
  Write-Host "The total size of file in $path is $($totalSize /1MB) MB."
  ```

- **Do-While and While Loops** (Path verification):
  ```powershell
  do {
      $path = Read-Host 'Please enter a file path to evaluate'
      if (Test-Path $path) {
          $pathVerified = $true
      }
  } while ($pathVerified -eq $false)
  ```

### File and Process Handling
You've shown how to handle large processes and count files and folders within a specified path, both excellent for administrative scripts or system management tasks:

```powershell
$largeProcesses = Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet64 -gt 50MB }

$path = 'C:\Test'
[int]$fileCount = 0
[int]$folderCount = 0
[int]$totalSize = 0
$rawFileInfo = Get-ChildItem $path -Recurse
foreach ($item in $rawFileInfo) {
    if ($item.PSIsContainer) {
        $folderCount++
    } else {
        $fileCount++
        $totalSize += $item.Length
    }
}
Write-Host "Breakdown of $path"
Write-Host "Total Directories: $folderCount"
Write-Host "Total Files: $fileCount"
Write-Host "Total Size of files: $($totalSize / 1MB) MB"
```

These examples effectively showcase PowerShell's power in scripting and automation, emphasizing its object-oriented approach, versatility in handling files and processes, and its capability to interact with the user dynamically.

Write-Output sends objects down the primary pipeline, also known as the "output stream" or the "success pipeline." To send error objects down the error pipeline, use Write-Error.
This cmdlet is typically used in scripts to display strings and other objects on the console. However, because the default behavior is to display the objects at the end of a pipeline, it is generally not necessary to use the cmdlet.

## Explanation

Your script demonstrates a broad range of PowerShell capabilities for handling input, processing it, and outputting results in various formats. Let’s discuss each part of your script:

### Input
1. **Invoke-WebRequest**:
   - You retrieve JSON content from a website, convert it to a PowerShell object, and then manipulate it. This is a great way to work with APIs and web data in PowerShell.
   ```powershell
   $webResults = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://reddit.com/r/powershell.json'
   $rawJSON = $webResults.Content
   $objData = $rawJSON | ConvertFrom-Json
   $posts = $objData.data.children.data
   $posts | Select-Object Title,Score | Sort-Object Score -Descending
   ```

2. **Read-Host**:
   - You interact with the user to get input, which you then use to filter and display data.
   ```powershell
   [int]$numPosts = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the number of posts to read"
   $posts | Select-Object Title,url | Sort-Object Score -Descending | Select-Object -First $numPosts
   ```

3. **Get-Content**:
   - You demonstrate how to read file content, search for patterns with regex, and filter logs, which is essential for file handling and data parsing.
   ```powershell
   $logContent = Get-Content C:\Test\SampleLog.log
   $logContent | Select-String -Pattern "INFO"
   ```

### Output
1. **Write-Host**:
   - This cmdlet is used for displaying data in the console with formatting options. While useful for debugging and scripts that exclusively interact with the console, it is generally avoided in production scripts as it does not output to the PowerShell pipeline.
   ```powershell
   Write-Host "Works Great" -ForegroundColor Green
   ```

2. **Write-Output**:
   - This is the default way PowerShell outputs data. It’s often used explicitly in scripts to make them more readable or when the output needs to be passed explicitly to the next command in the pipeline.
   ```powershell
   $processes = Get-Process
   Write-Output $processes
   ```

3. **Out-File and Export-Csv**:
   - These cmdlets are used to write output to files. `Out-File` writes data to a text file, while `Export-Csv` outputs data in CSV format, which is useful for exporting data that needs to be consumed by other programs or services.
   ```powershell
   $processes | Out-File C:\Test\processInfo.txt
   $processes | Export-Csv -Path c:\test\processes2.csv
   ```

### Summary
Your script effectively showcases how to integrate web APIs, handle user input, read and write files, and display outputs in PowerShell. Each of these operations is fundamental in PowerShell scripting, especially for tasks involving automation and data manipulation.

This script could be used as a template or a learning tool for those who want to understand how to perform common tasks in PowerShell effectively.

<#
we want to be notified when a drive in our home network is running low on space.
The script will check the desired drive for free space, 
and send a Telegram notification if it is below 20%.
All actions should be logged.
The script should support scannig a drive the user specifies.
The script should support both Linux and Windows.

The script you've provided is quite comprehensive and well-structured, serving the purpose of monitoring drive space and sending notifications via Telegram if the space falls below a certain threshold. Here's a breakdown and analysis to help you understand its components and functionalities:


### Script Breakdown

First, ensure you have the `PoshGram` module installed. You can install it from the PowerShell Gallery with the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PoshGram -Scope CurrentUser
```
#### **1. Execution Policies and Script Handling**
This part of your script handles the execution policies in PowerShell, which determine how PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. This ensures the script can execute without security restrictions that might block it.

```powershell
# List current execution policies
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

# Set execution policy to allow local scripts and downloaded scripts that are signed
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Unblock a script downloaded from the internet
Unblock-File -Path .\drive_warn.ps1

# Run a local script
.\drive_warn.ps1

# Run a local script in the current scope
. .\drive_warn.ps1
```

#### **2. Script Example with Parameters**
The main part of your script includes parameters and logic for determining drive space, logging actions, and sending notifications if necessary.

- **Parameters**: The script starts by defining a mandatory parameter `$Drive`, which specifies which drive to monitor.
  
- **Platform-Specific Paths**: It sets log paths depending on the operating system, accommodating both Windows and Linux platforms.

- **Logging Setup**: It checks if the log directory and file exist; if not, it creates them. It logs every significant step to help with debugging and tracking the script's operations.

- **Drive Space Checking**: The script checks the specified drive's free space percentage. It handles both Unix-like and Windows systems differently due to differences in cmdlets and object properties available on these platforms.

- **Telegram Notification**: If the free space percentage is below the set threshold, it imports the `PoshGram` module, constructs a message, and sends it using the Telegram bot.

```powershell
param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string] $Drive
)

# Different log path based on OS
if ($PSVersionTable.Platform -eq 'Unix') {
    $logPath = '/tmp'
} else {
    $logPath = 'C:\Logs'
}

$logFile = "$logPath\driveCheck.log"

# Ensure logging directory and file exist
try {
    if (-not (Test-Path -Path $logPath -ErrorAction Stop)) {
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $logPath -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
        New-Item -ItemType File -Path $logFile -ErrorAction Stop | Out-Null
    }
} catch {
    throw
}

Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "[INFO] Running $PSCommandPath"

# Checking drive space and logging
try {
    if ($PSVersionTable.Platform -eq 'Unix') {
        # Unix-like systems
        $volume = Get-PSDrive -Name $Drive -ErrorAction Stop
    } else {
        # Windows systems
        $volume = Get-Volume -ErrorAction Stop | Where-Object { $_.DriveLetter -eq $Drive }
    }

    if ($volume) {
        $total = $volume.Free + $volume.Used
        $percentFree = [int](($volume.Free / $total) * 100)
        Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "[INFO] Percent Free: $percentFree%"
    } else {
        throw "Drive $Drive was not found."
    }
} catch {
    Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "[ERROR] Unable to retrieve volume information: $_"
    throw
}

# Notification if below threshold
if ($percentFree -le 20) {
    try {
        Import-Module PoshGram -ErrorAction Stop
        Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value '[INFO] PoshGram imported successfully.'
        $messageSplat = @{
            BotToken    = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
            ChatID      = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
            Message     = "[LOW SPACE] Drive at: $percentFree%"
            ErrorAction = 'Stop'
        }
        Send-TelegramTextMessage @messageSplat
        Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value '[INFO] Message sent successfully'
    } catch {
        Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value "[ERROR] Error encountered sending message: $_"
        throw
    }
}
```

### Enhancements and Security
- **Secure Handling of Tokens**: Ensure that the Telegram bot token is securely handled, possibly using secure strings or encrypted storage.
- **Parameter Validation**: Adding validation logic for the `$Drive` parameter can help avoid errors due to invalid inputs.
- **Modular Design**: Consider wrapping different functionalities into functions for better readability and reusability.
- **Logging Improvements**: Implement more granular logging levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) to categorize log entries effectively.
