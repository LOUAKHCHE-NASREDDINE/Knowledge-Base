To activate a virtual environment (venv) in Python, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (if not already created)**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - This command will create a directory named `venv` in your project folder containing the virtual environment files.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS** and **Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Confirm Activation**:
   - Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to show the name of the virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)`).
   - You can also check the active environment by running:
     ```bash
     which python
     ```
     This should point to the Python executable inside the `venv` directory.

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment** (when done):
   - Simply run:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```
