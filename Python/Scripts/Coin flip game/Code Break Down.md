### Importing Libraries
```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **`random`**: This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. We use it to simulate random coin flips.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`)**: This module is a plotting library used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. Here, it is used to create a bar chart to display the results of the coin flips.

### Function to Simulate a Single Coin Flip
```python
def coin_flip():
    return "heads" if random.choice([True, False]) else "tails"
```
- **`random.choice([True, False])`**: This function randomly selects either `True` or `False`.
- **Return Value**: If `True`, the function returns "heads". If `False`, it returns "tails". This simulates a 50/50 chance coin flip.

### Function to Simulate Multiple Coin Flips
```python
def multiple_coin_flips(n):
    results = []
    for _ in range(n):
        results.append(coin_flip())
    return results
```
- **Parameters**: Takes an integer `n` representing the number of coin flips.
- **`results` List**: Initializes an empty list to store the results of each coin flip.
- **Loop**: Iterates `n` times, appending the result of each `coin_flip()` to the `results` list.
- **Return Value**: Returns the list `results` containing the outcomes of all `n` coin flips.

### Function to Track the Results and Write Them to a File
```python
def track_results(results, filename):
    heads_count = results.count("heads")
    tails_count = results.count("tails")

    with open(filename, "w") as file:
        file.write(f"heads: {heads_count}\n")
        file.write(f"tails: {tails_count}\n")
    print(f"Results written to {filename}")
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `results`: A list of strings ("heads" or "tails") representing the outcomes of coin flips.
  - `filename`: The name of the file where the results will be written.
- **Counting Results**:
  - `heads_count = results.count("heads")`: Counts the number of times "heads" appears in the `results` list.
  - `tails_count = results.count("tails")`: Counts the number of times "tails" appears in the `results` list.
- **Writing to File**:
  - Opens the file specified by `filename` in write mode.
  - Writes the counts of "heads" and "tails" to the file.
  - Prints a confirmation message indicating the results have been written to the file.

### Function to Display the Results as a Bar Chart
```python
def display_results(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        data = file.readlines()
    
    # Parse the results from the file
    results = {line.split(": ")[0]: int(line.split(": ")[1]) for line in data}
    labels = list(results.keys())
    counts = list(results.values())

    # Create a bar chart using matplotlib
    plt.bar(labels, counts, color=['blue', 'orange'])
    plt.xlabel('Outcome')
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.title('Coin Flip Results')
    plt.show()
```
- **Parameters**: `filename`: The name of the file where the results are stored.
- **Reading the File**:
  - Opens the file specified by `filename` in read mode.
  - Reads all lines from the file into a list called `data`.
- **Parsing the Results**:
  - Uses a dictionary comprehension to parse the results.
  - `line.split(": ")` splits each line at the `": "` delimiter.
  - The first element of the split (e.g., "heads") is used as the key, and the second element (converted to an integer, e.g., 42) is used as the value.
  - This creates a dictionary `results` with keys "heads" and "tails", and their respective counts as values.
- **Extracting Labels and Counts**:
  - `labels = list(results.keys())`: Extracts the keys ("heads", "tails") from the `results` dictionary.
  - `counts = list(results.values())`: Extracts the counts of heads and tails from the `results` dictionary.
- **Creating the Bar Chart**:
  - `plt.bar(labels, counts, color=['blue', 'orange'])`: Creates a bar chart with labels on the x-axis and counts as the height of the bars. The bars are colored blue and orange.
  - `plt.xlabel('Outcome')`: Sets the label for the x-axis to "Outcome".
  - `plt.ylabel('Count')`: Sets the label for the y-axis to "Count".
  - `plt.title('Coin Flip Results')`: Sets the title of the chart to "Coin Flip Results".
  - `plt.show()`: Displays the bar chart.

### Main Execution Block
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = "coin_flip_results.txt" 
    n = 100  # The number of coin flips
    results = multiple_coin_flips(n)
    track_results(results, filename)
    display_results(filename)
```
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This block ensures that the code within it runs only if the script is executed directly, not if it is imported as a module.
- **Setting Parameters**:
  - `filename = "coin_flip_results.txt"`: Sets the filename for storing results.
  - `n = 100`: Sets the number of coin flips to 100.
- **Simulating Coin Flips**:
  - `results = multiple_coin_flips(n)`: Simulates 100 coin flips and stores the outcomes in the `results` list.
- **Tracking Results**:
  - `track_results(results, filename)`: Writes the counts of "heads" and "tails" to the specified file.
- **Displaying Results**:
  - `display_results(filename)`: Reads the results from the file and displays them as a bar chart using `matplotlib`.

### Summary
This script simulates multiple coin flips, tracks the results, writes them to a file, and displays the results as a bar chart. It uses `random` for simulating coin flips, file operations for storing results, and `matplotlib` for visualizing the results.
