### Part 1: `generate_random_maze`

### Code:

```python
def generate_random_maze(size=5, wall_prob=0.3):
    maze = [[1 if random.random() < wall_prob else 0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    maze[0][0] = 0
    maze[size-1][size-1] = 0
    return maze

```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:**
    
    ```python
    def generate_random_maze(size=5, wall_prob=0.3):
    
    ```
    
    - Defines a function named `generate_random_maze` that takes two optional parameters: `size` (default is 5) and `wall_prob` (default is 0.3).
2. **Generate Maze:**
    
    ```python
    maze = [[1 if random.random() < wall_prob else 0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    
    ```
    
    - Creates a 2D list (a list of lists) to represent the maze.
    - `[[... for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]` constructs a square grid (2D list) of given `size`.
    - `1 if random.random() < wall_prob else 0` determines the value of each cell:
        - `random.random()` generates a random float between 0 and 1.
        - If this random float is less than `wall_prob`, the cell is set to `1` (wall).
        - Otherwise, the cell is set to `0` (path).
3. **Ensure Start Cell is Path:**
    
    ```python
    maze[0][0] = 0
    
    ```
    
    - Ensures that the start cell at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` is always a path (`0`).
4. **Ensure End Cell is Path:**
    
    ```python
    maze[size-1][size-1] = 0
    
    ```
    
    - Ensures that the end cell at the bottom-right corner `(size-1, size-1)` is always a path (`0`).
5. **Return Maze:**
    
    ```python
    return maze
    
    ```
    
    - Returns the generated maze.

### Part 2: `solve_maze`

### Code:

```python
def solve_maze(maze):
    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    start, end = (0, 0), (rows-1, cols-1)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    path = {start: None}

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == end:
            break
        for direction in directions:
            next_cell = (current[0] + direction[0], current[1] + direction[1])
            if (0 <= next_cell[0] < rows and 0 <= next_cell[1] < cols and
                next_cell not in visited and maze[next_cell[0]][next_cell[1]] == 0):
                queue.append(next_cell)
                visited.add(next_cell)
                path[next_cell] = current

    if end not in path:
        return "No path found"

    shortest_path = []
    step = end
    while step is not None:
        shortest_path.append(step)
        step = path[step]
    shortest_path.reverse()

    return shortest_path

```


### Function Definition and Initialization

```python
def solve_maze(maze):
```
- Defines a function named `solve_maze` that takes a single parameter `maze`, which is expected to be a 2D list representing the maze.

```python
    rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
```
- Calculates the number of rows and columns in the maze.
- `rows` is the number of sublists in `maze` (the number of rows).
- `cols` is the number of elements in the first sublist of `maze` (the number of columns).

```python
    start, end = (0, 0), (rows-1, cols-1)
```
- Sets the coordinates of the start cell to `(0, 0)` (top-left corner).
- Sets the coordinates of the end cell to `(rows-1, cols-1)` (bottom-right corner).

```python
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
```
- Defines the possible directions for movement:
  - `(-1, 0)` for moving up.
  - `(1, 0)` for moving down.
  - `(0, -1)` for moving left.
  - `(0, 1)` for moving right.

```python
    queue = deque([start])
```
- Initializes a deque (double-ended queue) with the start cell. The deque will be used to implement Breadth-First Search (BFS).

```python
    visited = set()
```
- Creates an empty set to keep track of cells that have been visited.

```python
    visited.add(start)
```
- Marks the start cell as visited by adding it to the `visited` set.

```python
    path = {start: None}
```
- Initializes a dictionary to keep track of the path. Each cell will map to its predecessor cell. The start cell maps to `None` because it has no predecessor.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Loop

```python
    while queue:
```
- Starts a loop that continues as long as there are cells in the queue.

```python
        current = queue.popleft()
```
- Dequeues the front cell from the queue and assigns it to `current`.

```python
        if current == end:
            break
```
- Checks if the current cell is the end cell. If it is, the loop breaks, indicating that the end has been reached.

```python
        for direction in directions:
```
- Iterates over the possible movement directions.

```python
            next_cell = (current[0] + direction[0], current[1] + direction[1])
```
- Calculates the coordinates of the next cell based on the current cell and the direction.

### Check Conditions for the Next Cell

```python
            if (0 <= next_cell[0] < rows and 0 <= next_cell[1] < cols and
                next_cell not in visited and maze[next_cell[0]][next_cell[1]] == 0):
```
- Checks if the next cell is within the bounds of the maze:
  - `0 <= next_cell[0] < rows` ensures the next cell's row index is valid.
  - `0 <= next_cell[1] < cols` ensures the next cell's column index is valid.
- Checks if the next cell has not been visited.
- Checks if the next cell is a path (`0`).

```python
                queue.append(next_cell)
```
- Enqueues the next cell to the queue for further exploration.

```python
                visited.add(next_cell)
```
- Marks the next cell as visited.

```python
                path[next_cell] = current
```
- Updates the path dictionary to indicate that the next cell was reached from the current cell.

### Check if Path Exists and Reconstruct Path

```python
    if end not in path:
        return "No path found"
```
- After the loop, checks if the end cell is not in the path dictionary, indicating no path was found from the start to the end. If so, returns "No path found".

### Path Reconstruction

```python
    shortest_path = []
```
- Initializes an empty list `shortest_path` to store the shortest path.

```python
    step = end
```
- Starts tracing back the path from the end cell.

```python
    while step is not None:
```
- Continues tracing back until reaching the start cell.

```python
        shortest_path.append(step)
```
- Appends the current step (cell) to the shortest path list.

```python
        step = path[step]
```
- Moves to the predecessor cell.

```python
    shortest_path.reverse()
```
- Reverses the shortest path list to get the correct order from start to end.

### Return the Shortest Path

```python
    return shortest_path
```
- Returns the shortest path from the start cell to the end cell.



### Example Usage

### Code:

```python
random_maze = generate_random_maze()
for row in random_maze:
    print(row)
print("Path found:", solve_maze(random_maze))

```

### Explanation:

1. **Generate Maze:**
    
    ```python
    random_maze = generate_random_maze()
    
    ```
    
    - Calls the `generate_random_maze` function to create a random maze and assigns it to `random_maze`.
2. **Print Maze:**
    
    ```python
    for row in random_maze:
        print(row)
    
    ```
    
    - Iterates through each row of the generated maze and prints it.
3. **Solve Maze:**
    
    ```python
    print("Path found:", solve_maze(random_maze))
    
    ```
    
    - Calls the `solve_maze` function to find the shortest path in the maze and prints the result.

This detailed breakdown should help you understand how each part of the code works and how the functions operate to generate and solve the maze.
