# Welcome to the DEVOPS Course Python Challenge!

Working from home sent us all... well, home. But we still like to get together for beer once in a while (according to regulations, of course). Our lives have changed, and getting everyone’s schedule to work is now a challenge.

## The Challenge

This is where you come in! We need a program that makes sense of everyone’s availability and tells us when we can meet.

### The Task

Each person has shared their availability and when their yard is available for hosting a meetup. Your program will read the provided `log.txt` file and output the best possible time and place for the meetup.

### Log Excerpt

Here is a sample from the Slack log:

```
Gil: I can do Wednesday at 18:00
Eli: I can do Monday at 13:00
Andrii: My yard is available Thursday at 16:00
George: My yard is available Sunday at 16:00
Daniel: My yard is available Monday at 10:00
```

### Expected Output

The program should output something like:

```
We will meet at Gil's house on Tuesday between 1700-1800.
```
