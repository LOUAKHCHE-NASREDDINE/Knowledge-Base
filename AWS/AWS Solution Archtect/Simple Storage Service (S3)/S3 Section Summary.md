### S3 Section Summary

#### <span style="color:#00b050">General Features of S3</span>
- **Object-Based Storage**: Allows you to upload and store files in the cloud. Not suitable for operating systems or databases.
- **Storage Limits**: Files can range from 0 bytes to 5 terabytes. Total data volume and number of objects are unlimited.
- **Buckets**: Files are stored in buckets. Buckets must have unique names globally and are referenced in URLs.
- **Universal Namespace**: Bucket names must be unique across all AWS users.
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Successful uploads return a HTTP 200 status code.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Key Concepts</span>
- **S3 Objects**:
  - **Key**: The object name (e.g., `Ralphie.jpg`).
  - **Value**: The actual data.
  - **Version ID**: Allows multiple versions of the same object.
  - **Metadata**: Data about the data (e.g., content type, last modified).

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Security and Access</span>
- **Private by Default**: S3 buckets and objects are private by default. Public access must be explicitly allowed.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Applied to individual objects to control access.
- **Bucket Policies**: Apply to entire buckets to manage access.
- **Static Website Hosting**: S3 can host static websites, scaling automatically to meet demand.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Versioning</span>
- **Purpose**: Stores all versions of an object, including deletions.
- **Backup Tool**: Acts as a backup by retaining object versions.
- **Disabling**: Can only be suspended, not disabled.
- **Integration**: Can work with lifecycle rules for automated transitions.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Storage Classes</span>
- **S3 Standard**: For most workloads (e.g., websites, mobile apps).
- **S3 Standard-IA**: For infrequently accessed but critical data.
- **S3 One Zone-IA**: For non-critical data in a single Availability Zone.
- **Glacier**: For archival with retrieval times within 12 hours.
- **Glacier Deep Archive**: Cheapest option for long-term storage with retrieval times up to 48 hours.
- **Intelligent-Tiering**: Uses machine learning to move objects between tiers based on access patterns.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Lifecycle Management</span>
- **Purpose**: Automates moving objects between storage tiers.
- **Integration**: Works with versioning for both current and previous versions.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock</span>
- **S3 Object Lock**: Implements a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) model.
  - **Governance Mode**: Allows specified users to overwrite or delete objects.
  - **Compliance Mode**: No user can overwrite or delete objects.
- **Glacier Vault Lock**: Enforces WORM for Glacier vaults. Once locked, policies cannot be changed.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Encryption</span>
- **In Transit**: Uses SSL/TLS (HTTPS).
- **At Rest**:
  - **SSE-S3**: Server-side encryption with S3 managed keys.
  - **SSE-KMS**: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS.
  - **SSE-C**: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys.
  - **Client-Side Encryption**: Encrypt objects before uploading to S3.
- **Enforcing Encryption**: Use bucket policies to ensure encryption.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Performance Optimization</span>
- **Prefixes**: Improve performance by spreading requests across multiple prefixes (folders/subfolders).
- **KMS Limits**: Be aware of KMS request limits (5,500, 10,000, or 30,000 requests per second).
- **Multipart Uploads**: Recommended for files > 100 MB; required for files > 5 GB.
- **Byte-Range Fetches**: Improve download performance by downloading specific byte ranges in parallel.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">S3 Replication</span>
- **Purpose**: Replicate objects from one bucket to another.
- **Versioning**: Required on both source and destination buckets.
- **Existing Objects**: Not automatically replicated; must use a batch job.
- **Delete Markers**: Not replicated by default but can be configured.

### <span style="color:#00b050">Summary</span>
- **S3**: Object-based storage suitable for various data types.
- **Security**: Private by default, with ACLs and bucket policies for access control.
- **Versioning**: Stores multiple versions of objects for backup and recovery.
- **Storage Classes**: Different tiers for different use cases and cost optimization.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automates transitions between storage tiers.
- **Object Lock**: WORM model for immutable data storage.
- **Encryption**: Options for securing data in transit and at rest.
- **Performance**: Optimize with prefixes, multipart uploads, and byte-range fetches.
- **Replication**: Ensure data redundancy and disaster recovery across regions.
