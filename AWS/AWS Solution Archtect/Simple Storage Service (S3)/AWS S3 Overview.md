### <span style="color:#00b050">AWS S3 Overview - Key Points</span>

#### <span style="color:#00b050">What is S3?</span>
- **S3** stands for **Simple Storage Service**.
- It provides **secure, durable, and highly scalable object storage**.
- S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a low cost.
- It is **object-based storage**, meaning it manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">S3 Basics</span>
- **Unlimited Storage**: You can store an unlimited number of objects, with each object being up to 5 terabytes in size.
- **Buckets**: Objects are stored in buckets, which are essentially folders within S3.
- **Universal Namespace**: Bucket names must be globally unique.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Key Concepts</span>
- **Key-Value Store**: Objects are stored as key-value pairs. The key is the object's name, and the value is the data itself.
- **Metadata**: Data about data, such as content type and last modified date.
- **Version ID**: Allows multiple versions of the same object when versioning is enabled.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Availability and Durability</span>
- **Availability**: S3 is designed for 99.95% to 99.99% service availability.
- **Durability**: S3 provides 11 9's (99.999999999%) durability, ensuring that data is not lost.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Storage Classes</span>
- **Standard S3**: The default storage class, designed for frequently accessed data.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Rules to automatically transition objects to cheaper storage classes or delete them after a set period.
- **Versioning**: Stores all versions of an object, allowing retrieval of deleted objects.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Security</span>
- **Server-Side Encryption**: Encrypts all new objects when they are stored in the bucket.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.
- **Bucket Policies**: Policies specific to the actions allowed or denied for a particular bucket, similar to IAM policies but bucket-wide.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Consistency Model</span>
- **Strong Read-After-Write Consistency**: Newly written objects are immediately readable. Updated objects are immediately available for reading after the update.
- **List Operations**: Newly written objects are immediately visible in listing operations.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Exam Tips</span>
- Remember that **S3 is object-based storage**.
- Objects can be up to 5 terabytes, and you have **unlimited storage**.
- Buckets must have **globally unique names**.
- Successful uploads return an **HTTP 200 status code**.
- Key concepts include the **key** (object name), **value** (data), **version ID**, and **metadata**.

#### <span style="color:#00b050">Practical Steps</span>
- In the next steps, you will learn to create an S3 bucket, upload objects, and understand the security implications of making objects public.
