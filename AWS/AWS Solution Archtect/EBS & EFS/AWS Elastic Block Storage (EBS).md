### AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) Overview

#### What is EBS?
- **Elastic Block Storage (EBS)** provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances. These volumes are like virtual hard disks in the cloud, offering scalable and reliable storage that automatically replicates within a single availability zone to protect against hardware failures.

#### Use Cases for EBS
- **Mission-Critical Applications:** EBS is built for high availability and durability, making it suitable for production workloads and mission-critical data.
- **Flexible Storage:** You can dynamically increase capacity and change volume types without downtime or performance impact.

#### Types of EBS Volumes
EBS volumes are categorized into solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs).

##### Solid-State Drives (SSDs)
1. **General Purpose SSD (gp2 & gp3)**
   - **gp2:** Balance of price and performance with 3 IOPS per GB, maxing out at 16,000 IOPS. Suitable for boot volumes, development, and test applications.
   - **gp3:** Provides predictable performance with 3,000 IOPS baseline and 125 MB/s throughput, regardless of volume size. Ideal for high-performance applications like MySQL, Cassandra, virtual desktops, and Hadoop analytics.

2. **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 & io2)**
   - **io1:** High performance, offering up to 64,000 IOPS and 50 IOPS per GB. Designed for I/O-intensive applications like large databases and latency-sensitive workloads.
   - **io2:** Enhanced durability and performance with 500 IOPS per GB and up to 64,000 IOPS, providing five nines (99.999%) durability.

##### Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
1. **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**
   - **st1:** Low-cost magnetic storage with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, burstable up to 250 MB/s per TB. Suitable for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads like big data, data warehouses, ETL, and log processing. Not suitable for boot volumes.

2. **Cold HDD (sc1)**
   - **sc1:** Lowest cost option with a baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB, burstable up to 80 MB/s per TB. Ideal for infrequently accessed data, such as file servers. Not suitable for boot volumes.

#### IOPS vs. Throughput
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):** Measures the number of read/write operations per second. Crucial for transaction-intensive applications needing low latency.
- **Throughput:** Measures the amount of data read/written per second (in MB/s). Important for large data sets and complex queries.

#### Choosing the Right EBS Volume
- **Big Data & Analytics:** Use throughput optimized HDD (st1).
- **Transactional Databases:** Use SSD (general purpose or provisioned IOPS).
- **Lowest Cost Storage:** Use cold HDD (sc1).

#### Exam Tips
1. **General Purpose SSD (gp2 & gp3):** Suitable for boot volumes and general applications. Provides up to 16,000 IOPS and three nines (99.9%) durability.
2. **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 & io2):** Required for high-performance applications needing more than 16,000 IOPS. io2 offers higher durability with five nines (99.999%).
3. **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Suitable for big data, data warehouses, ETL, and log processing. Not a boot volume.
4. **Cold HDD (sc1):** Suitable for less frequently accessed data and the lowest cost option. Not a boot volume.

#### Summary
- **Know Your Use Cases:** Match the EBS volume type with the specific workload requirements.
- **Understand Performance Metrics:** Differentiate between IOPS and throughput based on application needs.
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Be prepared to choose the appropriate EBS volume type based on given scenarios in the exam.

This summary provides a comprehensive understanding of AWS EBS, its volume types, use cases, and key considerations for selecting the right storage solution for various applications.
