### <span style="color:#ffc000">Compute</span>

**Compute** refers to the processing power needed to run applications and crunch data. Key compute services include:

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual machines that provide resizable compute capacity.
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing service where you only focus on your code without managing servers.
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: An easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. It automates the deployment of your applications by managing the underlying infrastructure.

### <span style="color:#ffc000">Storage</span>

**Storage** is where you keep your data safely in the cloud. Key storage services include:

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Highly scalable object storage service.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Virtual hard disks that can be attached to EC2 instances.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Managed file storage service for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
- **FSx**: Fully managed file storage that is optimized for a variety of workloads.
- **Storage Gateway**: Hybrid cloud storage service that provides on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.

### <span style="color:#ffc000">Databases</span>

**Databases** are used to store and retrieve structured information reliably. Key database services include:

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational database service supporting several database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
- **DynamoDB**: Managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
- **Redshift**: Managed data warehouse service that allows you to analyze large datasets using SQL and business intelligence tools.

### <span style="color:#ffc000">Networking</span>

**Networking** connects your compute, storage, and databases, and allows them to communicate with each other and the outside world. Key networking services include:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Allows you to create a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
- **Direct Connect**: Provides a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.
- **Route 53**: DNS web service for registering domain names and routing end-user requests to your applications.
- **API Gateway**: Fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale.
- **Global Accelerator**: Network service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with a global audience.
