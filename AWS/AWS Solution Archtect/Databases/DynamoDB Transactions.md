### Introduction to DynamoDB Transactions

- **DynamoDB Transactions**: Provide developers with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) across one or more tables within a single AWS account and region.

### Understanding ACID

- **ACID**: A set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably.
    - **Atomic**: All changes to the data must be performed successfully, or not at all.
    - **Consistent**: Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
    - **Isolated**: No other process can change the data while the transaction is running.
    - **Durable**: Changes made by a transaction must persist, even in the event of a system failure.

### Using ACID with DynamoDB

- **DynamoDB Transactions**: Ensure that operations across multiple items and tables are executed as a single, logical unit of work.
    - **Atomicity**: Either all operations in a transaction succeed or none do.
    - **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
    - **Isolation**: No other operations interfere with the transaction.
    - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent.

### Use Cases for DynamoDB Transactions

- **Financial Transactions**: Ensuring all related financial operations succeed or fail together.
- **Order Management**: Coordinating inventory updates, payment processing, and order confirmation in a single transaction.
- **Multiplayer Game Engines**: Managing state updates and ensuring consistency across game sessions.
- **Distributed Systems**: Coordinating actions across distributed components and services.

### DynamoDB Transactions Details

- **Operations**: Multiple "all or nothing" operations.
- **Read Options**:
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Best read performance, data consistency within one second.
    - **Strong Consistency**: Immediate consistency across all copies of data.
    - **Transactional**: Ensures all reads within a transaction reflect the state after all prior successful writes.
- **Write Options**:
    - **Standard**: Normal write operations.
    - **Transactional**: Ensures all writes within a transaction are applied together.
- **Limits**: Up to 25 items and 4 MB of data per transaction.

### Exam Tips

- **Scenario Questions**: If a question mentions ACID requirements, think of DynamoDB Transactions.
- **Key Facts**:
    - Transactions are "all or nothing".
    - Transactions provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability across one or more tables.
    - DynamoDB Transactions are used for applications requiring coordinated inserts, updates, or deletes across multiple items or tables.

By understanding these key points about DynamoDB Transactions, you will be well-prepared for related questions in the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.
