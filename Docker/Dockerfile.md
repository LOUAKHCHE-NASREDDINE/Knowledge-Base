Here’s an overview of common syntax and commands used in a `Dockerfile`:

### 1. `FROM`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the base image from which you are building.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```dockerfile
  FROM <image>[:<tag>]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu:20.04
  ```
  This command tells Docker to use the Ubuntu 20.04 image as the base for the new image.

### 2. `LABEL`
- **Purpose**: Adds metadata to the image.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  LABEL <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  LABEL maintainer="you@example.com"
  ```
  This adds metadata to the image, often used for specifying the maintainer.

### 3. `RUN`
- **Purpose**: Executes commands in the container to install packages or perform other setup tasks.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN <command>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
  ```
  This installs the Nginx web server in the image.

### 4. `COPY` and `ADD`
- **Purpose**: Copies files and directories from your host machine to the image.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY <src> <dest>
  ADD <src> <dest>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY . /app
  ADD source.tar.gz /app
  ```
  `COPY` copies files or directories, while `ADD` can also extract archives.

### 5. `WORKDIR`
- **Purpose**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR <path>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR /app
  ```
  Sets the working directory to `/app` inside the container. All subsequent commands will be run from this directory.

### 6. `CMD`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. Only one `CMD` instruction is allowed per Dockerfile.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  ```
  This sets the default command to run Nginx in the foreground.

### 7. `ENTRYPOINT`
- **Purpose**: Configures a container to run as an executable. Unlike `CMD`, it can’t be overridden easily by command line arguments.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  ```
  It makes the container behave like an executable with `nginx` as the default command.

### 8. `ENV`
- **Purpose**: Sets environment variables.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  ENV <key>=<value>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  ENV APP_HOME /app
  ```
  This sets the `APP_HOME` environment variable.

### 9. `EXPOSE`
- **Purpose**: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  EXPOSE 80
  ```
  This exposes port 80 for the container.

### 10. `VOLUME`
- **Purpose**: Creates a mount point with the specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  VOLUME ["/data"]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  VOLUME /app/data
  ```
  This will create a mount point for `/app/data`.

### 11. `USER`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the user to run the container as.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  USER <username>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  USER www-data
  ```
  This sets the user to `www-data` when running the container.

### 12. `ARG`
- **Purpose**: Defines a build-time variable that users can pass at build time to the builder.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  ARG <name>[=<default value>]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  ARG VERSION=1.0
  ```
  This defines a build-time argument named `VERSION` with a default value of `1.0`.

### 13. `SHELL`
- **Purpose**: Allows the default shell used by `RUN` commands to be overridden.
- **Syntax**:
  ```dockerfile
  SHELL ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  SHELL ["powershell", "-Command"]
  ```
  This changes the default shell to PowerShell.


```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Specify the base image
FROM <base_image>

# Step 2: Set environment variables
ENV <key>=<value>

# Step 3: Install dependencies
RUN <command>

# Step 4: Copy application code
COPY <source> <destination>

# Step 5: Define the working directory
WORKDIR <path>

# Step 6: Specify the command to run the application
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

# OR

# Step 7: Use ENTRYPOINT to set the main command
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

# Additional: Expose ports, set volumes, etc.
EXPOSE <port>
VOLUME ["/path"]

```

## Create docker file build Image and run container
### Step 1: Create a Basic Python Application

First, let's create a simple Python application. Create a directory for your project and inside it, create a file named `app.py`.

```python
# app.py
print("Hello, Docker!")
```

### Step 2: Create the `Dockerfile`

In the same directory as your `app.py`, create a file named `Dockerfile`. Here's a sample Dockerfile for your Python application:

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Specify the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Step 2: Set environment variables
ENV APP_HOME /app

# Step 3: Define the working directory
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Step 4: Copy application code
COPY . $APP_HOME

# Step 5: Install dependencies (if any)
# RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # Uncomment if you have a requirements.txt

# Step 6: Specify the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# Additional: Expose ports, set volumes, etc.
# EXPOSE 8080  # Uncomment if your app listens on a specific port
# VOLUME ["/data"]  # Uncomment if your app needs to use volumes
```

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Once your Dockerfile is ready, you can build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t python-hello-docker .
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

After building the image, you can run it with:

```bash
docker run python-hello-docker
```

### Explanation of the Dockerfile

- **FROM python:3.9-slim**: Uses a lightweight Python image as the base.
- **ENV APP_HOME /app**: Sets the environment variable `APP_HOME` to `/app`.
- **WORKDIR $APP_HOME**: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
- **COPY . $APP_HOME**: Copies the current directory’s content into the container's `/app` directory.
- **CMD ["python", "app.py"]**: Defines the command to run the application, which in this case is `python app.py`.

## `ARG` and `ENV`

The `ARG` and `ENV` instructions in a Dockerfile both allow you to define variables, but they serve different purposes and have different scopes and lifetimes.

### 1. **`ARG` (Build-time Argument)**

- **Purpose**: The `ARG` instruction defines a variable that users can pass at build time to the Docker build command using the `--build-arg` flag. This is useful for setting configuration values that might change depending on the environment in which the image is being built.

- **Scope**: `ARG` variables are only available during the build process. They cannot be accessed or used in the running container after the image has been built.

- **Lifetime**: The value of an `ARG` variable is only available during the image build process and does not persist after the image is built.

- **Usage Example**:

  ```dockerfile
  ARG VERSION=1.0
  RUN echo "Building version $VERSION"
  ```

  You can pass a different value when building the image:

  ```bash
  docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.0 -t myapp:2.0 .
  ```

  Here, `VERSION` is used only during the build process, for example, to install specific versions of software or to label the image.

### 2. **`ENV` (Environment Variable)**

- **Purpose**: The `ENV` instruction sets an environment variable that will be available both during the build process (after the `ENV` instruction is defined) and in the running container. These variables are typically used to configure the application or the environment in which it runs.

- **Scope**: `ENV` variables are available during both the build process and within the running container. They persist in the container and can be used by any processes that run within it.

- **Lifetime**: `ENV` variables are available for the lifetime of the container. Once set, they can be accessed by the application or scripts running inside the container.

- **Usage Example**:

  ```dockerfile
  ENV APP_HOME /app
  WORKDIR $APP_HOME
  ```

  In this example, `APP_HOME` is set to `/app`, and it will be available in both the build process and in the running container. Any processes or scripts in the container can access this variable.

### **Key Differences**

1. **Scope**:
   - **`ARG`**: Available only during the image build process.
   - **`ENV`**: Available during both the build process and in the running container.

2. **Lifetime**:
   - **`ARG`**: Exists only at build time and cannot be accessed in the container.
   - **`ENV`**: Persists and can be accessed throughout the container's lifecycle.

3. **Use Case**:
   - **`ARG`**: Best for setting build-time variables like versions, build-specific configurations, or temporary values that are only needed during the image creation.
   - **`ENV`**: Best for setting environment variables that your application will need to run, like paths, configuration settings, or any other data that should be available inside the container.

In summary, use `ARG` for variables that are only needed during the build process and won’t be required by the container once it’s running. Use `ENV` for variables that should be available during both the build and runtime of the container.

## Key Differences Between `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`

1. **Purpose**:
   - **`CMD`**: Provides default arguments for the container's main process. It can be overridden by command-line arguments when the container is run.
   - **`ENTRYPOINT`**: Defines the container's main executable, making the container behave like a command-line tool. The command set by `ENTRYPOINT` cannot be easily overridden by command-line arguments.

2. **Usage**:
   - **`CMD`**: Often used to specify the default command or arguments that should run when the container starts, but these can be changed by the user.
   - **`ENTRYPOINT`**: Used to set a fixed command that will always run, regardless of the arguments provided during the container's execution.

3. **Combination**:
   - **Together**: When both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` are used in the same Dockerfile, `CMD` provides default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` command.

4. **Example**:
   - **`CMD`**:
     ```dockerfile
     CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
     ```
     You can override `nginx` with another command at runtime: `docker run myimage bash`.

   - **`ENTRYPOINT`**:
     ```dockerfile
     ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
     ```
     The container will always run `nginx`, and arguments provided at runtime will be passed to `nginx`.

In summary, use `ENTRYPOINT` for the main command that should always run, and `CMD` for default arguments or commands that can be overridden.
### How its looks in Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# ENTRYPOINT example
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]

# CMD example
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
